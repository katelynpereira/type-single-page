# type-single-page
 
# I wanted to create a website that gave a royal feeling for the font, when i had struggled i used chat gpt to help with coding issues such as my fonts. I struggled a bit when it came to sections so i had to cut a lot of design from my figma mockup to the actual website. Overall I'm not too proud of how the website turned out, I think if i had made it from scratch or just had more time learning html i would be more prouder of how it turned out.

# I ended up finishing the project with chat gpt, as well as help from w3 schools. I had issues with my button not loading, fonts not loading in, and boxes overlapping text. I had to cut a lot of design details out but i was able to finish the project with what was needed.
